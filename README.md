This tester tests all the possible cases that your script, function, or program can go through, and of course to make sure that you didn't misspell a function name or program file name.

## How does the tester work ?

As simple as drinking water, you only have to follow those following steps:

 - clone this repository wherever you want.
 - add execute permission to `tester.sh` file as follows:
 ```cd C-Piscine_Tester && chmod +x tester.sh```
 - add your files to the expected directory `/{module}/user_{module}/`
 - then run `tester.sh` as follows:
 ```./tester.sh```
 - Finally, choose a module you want from tester to test.

 ## How do I know that if an exercise is correct or not ?

 There are two ways to know:
 
 - by color, if it's green, you're good to go, if it's red, you need to have another look into your script/code.
 - by KO/OK, if it’s [OK], you’re good to go, if it’s [KO], you need to have another look into your script/code.
